    "# English Premier League Match Outcome Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Contextualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the outcome of sports matches has always been a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. There are many variables that go into making a prediction, such as team performance, player conditions, and external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting the outcome of specific matches in the English Premier League (PL). The PL is arguably the most competitive football league in the world, attracting a massive pool of talented players. The season runs from August until May, where 20 teams compete in a league format to accumulate the most points throughout their 38-game campaign and lift the prestigious title.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation for AI Use\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation for employing AI in predicting match outcomes is to harness the power of data-driven decision-making. Traditional methods of forecasting match results, often based on expert opinion or simple statistics, can be subjective and limited in scope. Machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods which we'll use in this project, can leverage vast amounts of historical data to identify complex patterns and interactions between variables, providing more accurate and reliable predictions. These models can be particularly useful for fans, analysts, and sport bettors by increasing their capacity to make informed predictions.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of methodology, we will be using stacking classifier. This ensemble method combines multiple machine learning models to improve predictive performance. The following models were used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest Classifier**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their outputs to improve accuracy and control overfitting, while providing insight into the importance of specific features. This model is robust to noise which is another reason why it was selected.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **XGBoost Classifier**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an algorithm known for its high performance in classification task. It includes regularization parameters that help in preventing overfitting, making it a robust model like Random Forest. XGBoost is also designed to be efficient and scalable making it easier to handle large datasets and complex models which are great for further exploration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Logistic Regression is going to be used as the final estimator in the stacking classifier to combine the predictions of the base models, the Random Forest and XGBoost. It is a quite simple and easily interpretable model that can effectively weigh the outputs from the base models and produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three models work very well together as they each bring their own strength to the table. It's the equivalent of having three unique people observing something rather than just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the train-test split, we will be using an approximate 80/20 split. Using the first 24 seasons from 1993-2017 as the training set and the remaining 6 seasons from 2018-2023 as the test set. Our predictors will be `h/a`, `opp`, `day`, `home_form`, `away_form`, `h2h_wins`, `h2h_draws`, and `h2h_losses`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the initial stages of the model, I experimented with a Random Forest without hypertuning and it returned a ~57% accuracy with just `h/a`, `opp`, and `day`. Then I added `home_form`, `away_form`, `h2h_draws`, `h2h_draws`, and `h2h_losses` as well as XGBoost and Logistic Regression to hopefully increase the accuracy of the model."

Then we can use `GridSearchCV` to perform a search over the parameter grid we defined above. The last step is to fit the model and retrieve the best combination of hyperparameters found during the grid search.\n",
